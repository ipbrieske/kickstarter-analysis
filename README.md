# **An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns**
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends, specifically for theatre client

## **Overview of Project**

In this project, a client has asked us to perform an analysis of Kickstarter project data ranging from 2009 to 2017 in order to inform them of the best time to begin a campaign and the best funding goal to maximize their chance of running a successful campaign. The client will be funding a straight-play theatrical production, so we will be narrowing our dataset to only Theater Kickstarters in our "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date" sheet and further to only the Plays subcategory within the Theater category in our "Outcomes Based on Goals" sheet. The corresponding visualization charts are available as images in the Resources folder. 

Based on our initial dataset - "Kickstarter" - and previous knowledge of theater productions, I hypothesized that there would be no time of year that would affect outcomes, but that success would instead depend mainly on goal size and number of backers. 

## **Analysis and Challenges**

In order to derive our analysis, we needed to filter our data down to only the Theater category and then further into the Plays subcategory. After filtering for this data, we used Unix timestamp data included in the initial dataset to determine the start date of all campaigns. This information allows us to see a distribution of Kickstarter campaign outcomes over time, to determine the optimal time to begin a Play Kickstarter campaign. In our "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date" sheet, we generated a pivot table to filter by category and year of campaign start to get a distribution of aggregate campaign outcomes by month throughout all years included in our dataset. These results were separated into Canceled, Failed, Successful, and Total number of campaings. This information was used to generate our graph "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date." This graph shows us that Theater campaigns had the highest percentage of success during May each year, with the lowest percentage of success in December. 

This analysis must be tempered with the following considerations: Our data set includes only information from 2009 through March 2017. Monthly data after March will be skewed downward due to a lack of information for April '17 - Dec' 17. Additionally, after expanding our graph to visualize the total history of Theater campaigns, we notice two things. *[insert Theater Outcomes Over Time.png]* First, our data set is extremely limited from 2009 - 2013, with much more data available from 2014 - March 2017. Second, the total number of campaigns and percentage of success appears to be on a downward trend from 2014 - 2017, suggesting either a decrease in interest in Theater campaigns over time or potentially a decrease in the efficacy of Kickstarter as the most appropriate site for crowdfunding this type of campaign. Further analysis and data is necessary to determine these hypotheses. 

The next step of our analysis involved examining the relationship between the campaign funding goal and percentage of success for the Plays subcategory within the Theater category. In order to do so, we created a table breaking down goal sizes by $5000 intervals up to $50000+. We included a sub $1000 category as well, considering the high number of projects with a goal size below $1000. We then filtered our data to output the total number of Plays within each funding bracket by Number Successful, Failed, Canceled, and Total Projects, in order to derive the percentage of success for each funding bracket. This analysis is graphed in "Outcomes vs. Goals." From our graph, we are able to observe a generally inverse correlation between goal size and percentage of success. The highest percentage of success occurs in the sub $1000 bracket (76%), with the lowest percentage of success in the $45000 and above brackets (0% and 13% respectively).

This analysis must be qualified as follows: A clear break in our pattern occurs for campaigns between $15000 and $35000. To analyze this anomaly, we must look more closely at what caused projects in that range to achieve success. By filtering for results within these brackets, we are able to see the Blurb or description for each project. Some conjecture is required here, but my hypothesis is that Plays in this funding range are more likely to succeed because of two factors. One, the Blurbs for these projects almost all mention specific writers or actors, usually with considerable IMDB credits. These include such professionals as Austin Pendleton, William Francis Hoffman, and April Yvette Thompson. This conclusion would make sense - crowdfunding for small, local projects with a budget below $15000 make up the bulk of Play campaigns on Kickstarter (91.8%). Additionally, productions with budgets above $50000 would more likely be produced by established production companies. It would seem as though Kickstarter serves as an excellent platform for established but independent playwrights and actors to fund mid-tier Theater projects. Much more data and analysis is necessary to affirm or disprove this hypothesis. 

## **Results**

From our two studies, we are able to make two determinations:
1. The optimal time to begin a Theater Kickstarter campaing is in the month of May each year.
2. Kickstarters with funding goals below $15,000 have the highest degree of success, with success increasing as funding goal decreases. 

Our final determination for our client is that in order to have the best chance of success, they should begin their campaign in May with a goal below $15,000. These parameters give our client a 50% or higher chance of success given the data available. 

My initial hypothesis that outcomes would have no correlation with month was disproven - a very clear difference in outcomes is demonstrated between the Summer and Winter months. Additionally, my hypothesis that goal size would have a direct effect on success was proven true, with qualifications. A negative correlation exists between goal size and percentage of success, with an anomaly present between goal sizes of $15,000 and $35,000. I included my hypothesis as to why this anomaly exists above. My hypothesis that number of backers would affect campaign success was neither proven nor disproven during our analysis. 

If we wish to further refine our data, I would prescribe expanding our data set to include crowdfunding sites other than Kickstarter, to determine if the seasonality of success is applicable to all crowdfunding sites or just Kickstarter. I would also like to look further into the correlation between number of backers and average donation in order to help our client determine the optimal tiers of contributions available to backers. Our dataset also includes information on if each project was highlighted in the Kickstarter "Spotlight" or "Staff Pick" sections, thereby increasing the genearl level of engagement and visibility of the project. I would hypothesize this has a large impact on the success of any given project. An analysis of percentage of success for Spotlight and Staff Pick projects would be required.
